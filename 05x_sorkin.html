    New York Times columnist and author, Andrew Ross Sorkin, has been described as the most famous financial journalist of his generation. A leading voice on Wall Street and corporate America, his New York Times bestseller, Too Big to Fail, was the first true, behind-the-scenes, moment-by-moment account of how that financial crisis developed into a global tsunami.
